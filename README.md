# Enterprise Manufacturers Ltd Supplier Quality Performance analysis

## Project Overview 

This data analysis project aims to provides essential insights into the performance of suppliers, the quality of materials, and the operational impact of defective materials across different plants. The data visulization (dashboard) is designed to help management quickly identify areas that need attention, make informed decisions about suppliers, and optimize procurement processes.

- PowerBi  - Creating Reports


  ### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formating.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the supplier data to answer key questions, such as

- Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest defect quantity?
- Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest downtime?
- Is there a particular combination of material and vendor that perform poorly?
- Is there a particular combination of Vendor and plant that performs poorly?
- How does the same vendor and material perform across different plants?

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The team has successfully consolidated data from multiple plants, providing a comprehensive view of materials, defects, and suppliers.
2. They have gathered information on the number of defective materials received, which could help in identifying quality issues with specific suppliers or materials.
3. The data includes a value for the number of minutes of downtime caused by defective materials, which highlights the operational impact and cost implications.
4. They have linked defect data to specific vendors, allowing for the identification of which suppliers are contributing more to material defects and resulting downtime.

### Recomendations

Base on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Implement a centralized procurement and supplier management system that can track vendor performance consistently across all plants. This system should integrate data on material quality, defect rates, and downtime, ensuring that all plants are using the same set of criteria for evaluating suppliers.
- Define clear supplier quality metrics, and use these to score or rank suppliers
- Conduct regular supplier performance reviews based on the data collected, with a focus on identifying root causes of defects and downtime
- Improve communication channels with suppliers by providing them with data on defect rates and downtime caused by their materials. Create collaborative efforts to improve material quality and reliability.
- For suppliers with consistently poor performance, establish a program to improve their perfomances which includes clear expectations for quality improvements, timelines, and penalties for non-compliance.
